The present application aims to centralize all the DevSecOps technical documentation to use and develop ConfianceAI environment.

The documentation follows this given structure:

- `Confiance environment`: Confiance.AI components and development practices (CI/CD usage, component integration flow, templates...).
- `Cluster`: Cluster configuration and CI/CD development.

This application uses Docusaurus v2, an open source static site builder dedicated to documentation. Please read the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) if you are new to it to participate in the development of this documentation.
